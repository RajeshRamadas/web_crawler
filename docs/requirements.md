# Requirements for Web Crawler

## Functional Requirements

1. **Fetch Pages from the Web**
   - The system must retrieve pages using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

2. **Link Discovery**
   - Automatically identify and follow links to discover new pages.

3. **Data Storage and Indexing**
   - Store raw content, metadata, and extracted data for querying and processing.

4. **Content Handling**
   - Support for different types of pages, including HTML, XML, PDFs, and images.

5. **Avoid Redundant Crawling**
   - Implement deduplication to prevent repeatedly crawling the same pages.

## Non-functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**
   - Capable of handling large volumes of data and scaling horizontally with distributed systems.

2. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Ensure robustness to recover from errors like website downtime, connection failures, or corrupted data.

3. **Crawling Ethics**
   - Respect robots.txt directives and implement configurable crawl rates to avoid overloading servers.

4. **Performance**
   - Achieve efficient crawling with minimal latency and optimal resource usage.

5. **Monitoring**
   - Provide real-time statistics and logs for monitoring performance and debugging.

# Architecture Overview

## Components

### 1. **URL Frontier**
   - **Purpose:** Stores and manages URLs to be crawled.
   - **Features:**
     - URL deduplication.
     - Prioritization based on domain, freshness, or user-defined rules.

### 2. **Downloader**
   - **Purpose:** Fetches web pages from the internet.
   - **Features:**
     - Handles retries, rate limits, and timeouts.
     - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous downloading.

### 3. **Parser**
   - **Purpose:** Extracts data and links from downloaded pages.
   - **Features:**
     - Parses HTML, JSON, XML, and PDFs.
     - Applies filters for link inclusion/exclusion.

### 4. **Data Storage**
   - **Purpose:** Stores crawled data and indices for querying.
   - **Features:**
     - Stores raw HTML, metadata, and parsed data.
     - Uses databases like MongoDB, Elasticsearch, or PostgreSQL.

### 5. **Scheduler**
   - **Purpose:** Manages the crawling process and task distribution.
   - **Features:**
     - Retrieves URLs from the frontier and assigns tasks.
     - Supports distributed task assignment.

### 6. **Distributed Framework**
   - **Purpose:** Enables horizontal scaling for high-volume crawling.
   - **Features:**
     - Distributed queues like Kafka or RabbitMQ.
     - Supports sharding of the URL frontier.

### 7. **Robots.txt Handler**
   - **Purpose:** Ensures compliance with website crawling policies.
   - **Features:**
     - Fetches and parses robots.txt files.
     - Respects directives like disallow and crawl-delay.

### 8. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Purpose:** Tracks system performance and logs errors.
   - **Features:**
     - Dashboards for real-time monitoring.
     - Logging using ELK Stack or Prometheus/Grafana.

# Workflow

1. **Seed URLs**
   - Start with an initial set of URLs, either user-provided or from known sources.

2. **URL Frontier Management**
   - Add discovered links to the frontier.
   - Prioritize URLs based on freshness, domain, or user preferences.

3. **Page Downloading**
   - Fetch pages with respect to robots.txt and rate limits.

4. **Parsing and Extraction**
   - Parse content to extract links and relevant information.
   - Normalize and filter discovered URLs.

5. **Data Storage**
   - Store raw content, metadata, and parsed data in a scalable database.

6. **Indexing**
   - Build indices for efficient search and data retrieval.

# Scalability Considerations

1. **Distributed Crawling**
   - Use multiple crawlers across servers or regions for better throughput.

2. **Sharding**
   - Divide the URL frontier into shards based on domain or hash for parallel processing.

3. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Implement retry mechanisms and failover support for node failures.

4. **Storage**
   - Use scalable storage solutions like HDFS, S3, or cloud databases for large datasets.

# Ethical Considerations

1. **Respect Robots.txt**
   - Ensure strict adherence to crawling rules specified by websites.

2. **Rate Limits**
   - Prevent overloading servers by implementing appropriate delays between requests.

3. **Privacy**
   - Avoid collecting sensitive or personal information without consent.
